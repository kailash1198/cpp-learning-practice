// STL - STL means Standard Template Library
// STL is a collection of Header Files that provide lots of data structure , algorihms and function to simplyfy the coding experience.

// Main use of STL is this ready to use that means we can save lots of time and effcienty while coding.

// Mostly 3 main categories have of STL :
// 1. Container  2. Algorithms   3. Iterators

// 1. Container : STL container store data and organize those data in a specific manner as required. and you can    manipulate these data.
// 2. Algorithm : Algorithms is step by step instruction for solve problems.
// 3. Iteratore : Iterators are object that are used to access elements of container.
