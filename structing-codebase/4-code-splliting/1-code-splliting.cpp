#include <iostream>
// Code splitting - This code splitting help us to divide large code to small file or modules for better manage code.
// Code splitting generally achived by use seprate compilation, header files and source files.

// 1. Header files - usually .h or .hpp extension.This help us to write code in other file and add in main file. This helps us for manage dublicate name conflict error.

// 2. Source Files - This usually .cpp extension. This is responsible for actual functionality defined in corrosponding header files.

// 3. Separate Compilation - That means each source file can be compiled independently into an object files. And this object file can linked together to form the final executable.
